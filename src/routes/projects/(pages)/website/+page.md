# My Website
## The site you're on now ;)

This is a basic website I set up as an introduction and to show off all my projects (of which I have very few at the time of writing). I am not very good at web dev compared to some other types of development, so this site doubles as a learning experience. I also probably could not have done it without help from [sexnine](https://github.com/sexnine).

I made this website using [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/), [TailWind](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling, and [mdsvex](https://mdsvex.pngwn.io/) to write pages using markdown, including this one! This site isn't exactly *professional*, or *polished*, but it's more of a place for me to mess around with web dev and see what I can make.
